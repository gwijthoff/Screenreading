    Screenreading:\
    **Midterm Exam**
author: ENGL W3986 | Spring 2014 | Columbia University
date: due **Sunday, March 30, 2014**

In his book of *Keywords* in society and culture, Raymond Williams writes that each  entry (like author, ideology, press) conveys an entire "field of meanings" that shifts with historical context and usage. The purpose of this assignment is to trace through individual keywords how the meaning of cultural practices change as they encounter new technologies and new social forms.

Based on our readings so far this semester, choose **any three** of the following five keywords, and write a three page (or 1000 word) entry on each.  You must cite *at least* two different sources to support your entry.  Use the Williams book I circulated as a style guide, if need be.

- alphabet
- global village / universal library
- colophon / metadata
- content
- writing

The midterm is due to my inbox by Sunday night, March 30th -- midnight at the latest.
